##I created these projects during the last course my coursera specialisation

### PIL project 

I used Pillow Library to convert a given image to a “contact Sheet” of the given image with varied intensities and Channels.

### PyTesseract_tutorial

I learned to use pytesseract or google's tesseract OCR engine with python in this tutorial or project

### openCV project

Here I Used OpenCV to create a search algorithm that could search through a newspaper Image dataset and get the human faces on the page with the given words and build a contact sheet to show the resulting images.
